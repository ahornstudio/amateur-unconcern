					<p>CAPTAIN SHOTOVER: Well, one turns the cheek: the other kisses it. One provides the cash: the other spends it.
					ELLIE DUNN: Who will have the best of the bargain, I wonder?</p>
					<p>CAPTAIN SHOTOVER: You. These fellows live in an office all day. You will have to put up with him from dinner to breakfast; but you will both be asleep most of that time. All day you will be quit of him; and you will be shopping with his money. If that is too much for you, marry a seafaring man: you will be bothered with him only three weeks in the year, perhaps.</p>
					<p>ELLIE DUNN: That would be best of all, I suppose.</p>
