				<h1>Introduction</h1>

 			<div class="col-sm-6">
				 
				 <p>The years 2014-18 mark the centenary of the First World War, a ‘tragic and unnecessary conflict’, as described by historian John Keegan. The event, in all its military aspects, has been and will continue to be heavily commemorated worldwide, including the UK’s state-funded £10 million centenary cultural programme, ‘14-18 NOW’, which selected projects ‘to encourage people from every community to reflect on how the First World War has shaped today’s world and our attitudes to conflict now’. </p>
				  
				 <p>Departing from the ‘bellicose mood’ of the centenary commemorations, The Photocaptionist, a platform devoted to the relationship between photographs and words, founded by Federica Chiocchetti, presents Amateur Unconcern: A Photo-Literary Fantasia. Exploring notions of frivolity, privilege, moralism and political disengagement of ‘cultured, leisured Europe’ just before, during and immediately after the Great War, the exhibition offers an overlooked angle to the cruelty of the battlefield. It takes as its starting point George Bernard Shaw’s 1919 play Heartbreak House, an eccentric narrative on what Shaw describes as the ‘moral vacuum’ of the upper and middle classes towards WW1 and its consequences. Equally inspiring was Alexander Sokurov’s 1987 film Skorbnoye Beschuvstviye [Mournful Unconcern], an adaptation of Heartbreak House that accentuates the contrast between the incumbent presence of the war and the characters’ languid refusal to interrupt their privileged alleged normality.</p>
				 
				<p>With this frivolous and unconcerned atmosphere in mind, the Photocaptionist researched the extensive collections of the London-based Archive of Modern Conflict, to select extraordinary and previously unseen photographic material of the epoch and combine it with excerpts of Shaw’s Heartbreak House. Through the images of a few European amateur photographers who, between 1913 and 1919, enjoyed shooting landscapes and people, resting or nurturing their hobbies, ironically including hunting, we experience the years of the Great War far removed from the carnage of the trenches, questioning their disturbing inoffensiveness.</p>
				 
				<p>The exhibition, presented as a photo-literary montage, invites the viewer to reflect on the notion of ‘indifference’ but also on the idea of the precariousness of photography as a provider of tangible evidence for intangible aspects of reality, such as states of mind and feelings. Through the glass negatives and photo albums of these early XX century European amateurs we can only identify 'moments' of seeming unconcern in their lives and in the lives of their subjects. Indeed photography never tells us the whole story. We ignore what they had been up to before and after the images were taken. It would be problematic to accuse them of indifference, since their unconcern, like their photography, can only be described as amateur.</p>
